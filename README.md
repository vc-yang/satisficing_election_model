# Repository for "Why are U.S. parties so polarized? A 'satisficing' dynamical model"

This is the code repository for the paper "Why are U.S. parties so polarized? A 'satisficing' dynamical model."

The main file is `main3_optimize_match_DW_data.m`. The code simulates the trajectory of party positions according to the "satisficing" model, and compares it with historical party position data from the DW-NOMINATE. The code also has an option for optimizing the parameters to fit the data. 

The code was written in MATLAB 2016a.
